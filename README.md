## How to Play

### On Computer
1. Click dandelions to kill them.
2. Click power-ups to trigger them.

### On Mobile
1. Touch dandelions to kill them.
2. Touch power-ups to trigger them.

## Recommendations

I think the game is best played on a mobile device.  The more touches you can do, the more dandelions you can kill.  A mouse is 2nd best, followed by a touchpad.

## Mechanics

- You complete a level by getting a certain number of points
- You get points by killing dandelions, even if they spawn more
- You get 0-3 star per level based on how fast you complete it
- You get power-ups based on how many stars you get
- Power-ups can be used to help you clear dandelions faster, and you can revisit old levels with your power-ups to clear them faster

## Inspiration

As a home owner, I feel the call to adventure to keep my lawn green and free of weeds.  I never thought I would care this much, but here we are.  Dandelions are the bane of my existence, so alas, I made a game about it.

All of the level titles are a play on words from my favorite book series.
